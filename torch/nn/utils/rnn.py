class PackedSequence(PackedSequence_):
    r"""Holds the data and list of batch_sizes of a packed sequence.

    All RNN modules accept packed sequences as inputs.

    Note:
        Instances of this class should never be created manually. They are meant
        to be instantiated by functions like :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.

        Batch sizes represent the number elements at each sequence step in
        the batch, not the varying sequence lengths passed to
        :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.  For instance, given data  ``abc`` and `d`
        the ``PackedSequence`` would be ``adbc`` with ``batch_sizes=[2,1,1]``.

    Attributes:
        data (Variable): Variable containing packed sequence
        batch_sizes (list[int]): list of integers holding information about
            the batch size at each sequence step

def pack_padded_sequence(input, lengths, batch_first=False):
    r"""Packs a Variable containing padded sequences of variable length.

    Input can be of size ``TxBx*`` where T is the length of the longest sequence
    (equal to ``lengths[0]``), B is the batch size, and * is any number of
    dimensions (including 0). If ``batch_first`` is True ``BxTx*`` inputs are
    expected.

    The sequences should be sorted by length in a decreasing order, i.e.
    ``input[:,0]`` should be the longest sequence, and ``input[:,B-1]`` the
    shortest one.

    Note:
        This function accept any input that has at least two dimensions. You
        can apply it to pack the labels, and use the output of the RNN with
        them to compute the loss directly. A Variable can be retrieved from
        a :class:`PackedSequence` object by accessing its ``.data`` attribute.

    Arguments:
        input (Variable): padded batch of variable length sequences.
        lengths (list[int]): list of sequences lengths of each batch element.
        batch_first (bool, optional): if ``True``, the input is expected in BxTx*

    decreasing length.

    B is batch size. It's equal to the number of elements in ``sequences``.
    T is length longest sequence.
    L is length of the sequence.
    * is any number of trailing dimensions, including none.

    Example:
        >>> from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence
